# Jumping Jackpot

Jumping Jackpot is an interactive game developed by myself, Mueez Khan, and Amal Suleiman. The rules are simple: jump whenever the glowing lights hit the ground near you (like you would a skipping rope), and get successful jumps for an increased multiplier bonus! Beware though: the higher your multiplier is, the harder the the difficuty will get. It is based on the original Jumping Fantasy arcade game typically seen in arcades such as Chuck E. Cheese's. It is written in Java and C++, and consists of an LED ring, an Arduino Lilypad (with accelerometer), and a computer to run the Java program. All components communicate using the Zigbee protocol.
